    "enGB": "By keeping his hands stiff and his arms loose and ready, the disciple uses his bare palms as shields to protect himself from the weapons of his foes. While in this stance, the initiator gains a +2 shield bonus to his AC while he has at least one free hand. At the initiator’s 6th initiator level, this bonus increases by +1, again at 12th level, and a final time at 18th level."
