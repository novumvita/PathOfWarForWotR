         * The fighting style of the cavalier has always been associated with glory, majesty, and respect, viewing combat as an elegant and formal pursuit. Many experienced cavaliers come to realize, however, that warfare is not often the clean and mystical profession which so many flaunt, and so adapt their showy nature into a more vicious and efficient arsenal. These cavaliers are known as hetairoi, and many are the enemies who have fallen unprepared when dealing with these cavaliers’ brutal efficiency.

A hetairos adds Acrobatics to his list of class skills.
Maneuvers

A hetairos begins his career with knowledge of three martial maneuvers. The disciplines available to him are Golden Lion, Piercing Thunder, and Scarlet Throne. Undead and other hetairos healed by negative energy can exchange one of these disciplines for Unquiet Grave instead.

Once the hetairos knows a maneuver, he must ready it before he can use it (see Maneuvers Readied, below). A maneuver usable by hetairos is considered an extraordinary ability unless otherwise noted in it or its discipline’s description. A hetairos maneuvers are not affected by spell resistance, and he does not provoke attacks of opportunity when he initiates one.

The hetairos learns additional maneuvers at higher levels, as indicated on Table: Archetype Maneuver Progression. The maximum level of maneuvers gained through hetairos levels is limited by those listed in that table as well, although this restriction does not apply to maneuvers added to his maneuvers known through other methods, such as prestige classes or the Advanced Study feat. A hetairos must meet a maneuver’s prerequisite to learn it.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even numbered initiator level thereafter (6th, 8th, 10th, and so on), the hetairos can choose to learn a new maneuver in place of one he already knows. In effect, he loses the old maneuver in exchange for the new one. He can choose a new maneuver of any level he likes, as long as he observes the restriction on the highest-level maneuvers he knows; the hetairos need not replace the old maneuver with a maneuver of the same level. He can swap only a single maneuver at any given level.

A hetairos’ initiation modifier is Charisma, and each hetairos level is counted as a full initiator level.
Maneuvers Readied

A hetairos can ready all three of his maneuvers known at 1st level, and as he advances in level and learns more maneuvers, he is able to ready more, but must still choose which maneuvers to ready. A hetairos must always ready his maximum number of maneuvers readied. He readies his maneuvers by practicing weapon drills or performing some act of meditation for ten minutes. The maneuvers he chooses remain readied until he decides to practice again and change them. The hetairos does not need to sleep or rest for any long period of time in order to ready his maneuvers; any time he spends ten minutes meditating, he can change his readied maneuvers.

A hetairos begins an encounter with all his readied maneuvers unexpended, regardless of how many times he might have already used them since he chose them. When he initiates a maneuver, he expends it for the current encounter, so each of his readied maneuvers can be used once per encounter (unless he recovers them, as described below).

In order for the hetairos to recover maneuvers, he must spend a full-round action to adjust his position and refocus his assault. The hetairos regains a number of expended maneuvers equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 2), and he or his mount may move up to their speed as part of this action. The first attack that the hetairos makes after performing this action gains a bonus on the attack roll equal to the hetairos’ Charisma modifier and ignores any damage reduction or hardness the target may possess. Alternately, the hetairos may center himself to recover a single maneuver as a standard action.

This ability replaces challenge
Stances

A hetairos begins his career with knowledge of one stance from any discipline open to hetairos. At 4th, 7th, 11th, and 13th levels, he can select an additional stance to learn. The maximum level of stances gained through hypnotic duelist levels is limited by those listed in Table: Archetype Maneuver Progression. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended and the hypnotic duelist does not have to ready them. All the stances he knows are available to his at all times, and he can change the stance he is currently maintaining as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance or discipline description.

Unlike with maneuvers, a hetairos cannot learn a new stance at higher levels in place of one he already knows.
Mounted Maneuver Expertise (Ex)

Starting at 1st level, a hetairos and his trusty steed are so in tune with each other that they can work as one when performing maneuvers. Whenever a hetairos is mounted and uses a maneuver with a movement component (such as making a charge attack, or taking an extra move action), the hetairos can have his mount take the appropriate movement in his place. If the maneuver allows the hetairos to make a charge attack, both him and his mount are considered to be charging.
Slaying Charge (Ex)

At 11th level, the hetairos gains Martial Charge as a bonus feat (or another combat feat if they already possess Martial Charge). In addition, he gains a +4 bonus to skill checks made as part of a maneuver and the DCs of any maneuvers if he uses the maneuver while charging.

This ability replaces Mighty Charge
Coordinated Reformation (Ex)

At 12th level, whenever the hetairos regains maneuvers as a full-round action, he may allow all allies within 30 feet to move up to half their speed as a free action. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

This ability replaces demanding challenge.
